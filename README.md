# ComparingInputs
Microchip PIC Microcontroller: 2 Switches, 1 potentiometer, and 2 Leds

This program is about comparing 3 inputs and turning the leds on/off based on the statement defined in the code.
Two of the inputs are switches, one a potementer. The Led's outputs are purely based on the two switches states (on/off) and the potentiometer ranges.
